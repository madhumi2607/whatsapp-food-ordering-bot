# 🍽️ WhatsApp Food Ordering Bot

An AI-powered **WhatsApp food ordering assistant** built using **n8n**, **Groq LLM**, and **Google Sheets**.
The bot allows users to check menu availability, place orders, and get instant responses — all through WhatsApp.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **workflow automation + LLMs** can be used to build a real-world conversational system.

Users can:

* Interact using **natural language or numbered options**
* Check food availability in real time
* Place confirmed orders
* Get FAQs like delivery time and payment methods

All responses are **clean, human-like**, with **no backend or tool logic exposed**.
